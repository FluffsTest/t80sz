# Installation
Clone the repo, as usual, and then install the dependencies:
```
npm i
```

After that:
- If you want to test/debug the site, use `npm run dev`
- Else, run `npm run compile`, later following with a `npm run start` to initialize the server.

# Debug
A Debug Menu is available at the Dev Server's `debug/` directory (by default: `localhost:8080/debug`).

From there, you can test and work with the site's features in a more compact form.
This is a test of githubs push thingy.
